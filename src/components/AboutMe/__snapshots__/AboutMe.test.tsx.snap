    Hi! Pleasure
     ðŸ’œ 
    <br />
    <br />
    I am a developer with a sparkle in my eye, who is always looking for the next level and who strives to bring relevant issues to the community.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am passionate about creating useful and good quality products for users, I currently have 2 years in the development area and I am improving both in the technical part and in the leadership part of a team.
    <br />
    <br />
    Some of my goals are to have continuous growth, impact people's lives and build good quality interfaces.
